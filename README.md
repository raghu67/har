The goal of this document is to analyze the accelerometer data from several users performing wight lifting exercises and fit a machine learning model to the data that allows us to predict the activity they are performing by looking at the sensor data. The data for this project come from this source: http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har.
